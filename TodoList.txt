# + mean already fixed
# - mean not yet fixed


things need to remember :
1. fix input length validation (-)
    the system will crash if the length of input 
    is exceeding the record type length.

2. add authentication for user login (-) 
    so the user will cannot use the app if 
    the session is expired.

3. make the design looks prettier (-)
    atleast can be accepted by average 
    human eyes.

4. create middleware for some of tab_user record (-).
