things need to remember :
1. fix input length validation (-)

    is exceeding the record type length.

2. add authentication for user login (+) 
    so the user will cannot use the app if 
    the session is expired.

3. make the design looks prettier (+)
    atleast can be accepted by average 
    human eyes.

4. create middleware for some of tab_user record (-).

5. hash the password to the md5 encryption (-)
    and make the login form decrypt it everytime want to login.
